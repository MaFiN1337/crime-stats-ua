# Project Overview

The objective of this project is to gather, analyze, and visualize data related to crimes over the period from 2014 to 2024. We will examine the factors influencing the commission of particular crimes, analyze real-life cases, and present hypotheses on the primary mechanisms driving individuals to commit violations. The project will include visualizations (charts and graphs) representing data such as the number of cases over the years and months, suspicion reported, sent to court, proceedings closed,proceedings suspended, no decisions have been made.

The analysis is based on various articles and case studies, which will be examined in detail throughout the project. These articles explore the legal framework, contributing factors, and real-life examples.


## High treason (Article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine) and joint activities

- High treason - intentional actions of a citizen of Ukraine to the detriment of sovereignty, territorial integrity, defense capability, state security, etc.; during war, the application is strengthened by changes to the Criminal Code and the practice of distancing oneself from collaborationism `(Article 111-1)`.

  Qualification approaches and case law are discussed in detail in the article [Атонюк Н., 2022](https://www.academia.edu/download/88623963/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%96%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%B4%D1%96%D1%8F%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%96%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C.pdf). 

- Collaborative activities `(Art. 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine)` - a wider range of actions in favor of the aggressor state (information support, administration on TOT, etc.); it is important to correctly distinguish from Art. 111 when qualifying.

### Factors (mechanisms) influencing the commission of treason

A practical intelligence framework [MICE](https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/9ccc45dc156271d11769e5205ec49c29/Alt-Framework-Agent-Recruitment-1.pdf) explains the motivations for collaborating with the enemy
- Money, 
- Ideology, 
- Coercion/Compromise, 
- Ego 

The modern approach complements it with the model [RASCLS](https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/9ccc45dc156271d11769e5205ec49c29/Alt-Framework-Agent-Recruitment-1.pdf) as influence/recruitment tools.
- Reciprocation, 
- Authority, 
- Scarcity, 
- Commitment/Consistency, 
- Liking, 
- Social proof

### Hypotheses (factor → mechanism → example)

- Ideology/political loyalty (MICE: Money/Ideology/Ego ; RASCLS: Authority/Liking/Social proof).
  - Hypothesis: public figures with media influence/political connections can become leaders of the interests of the Russian Federation (info-operations, legitimization of decisions), which leads to treason.

    **Examples:** [suspicion of People's Deputy O. Dubinsky](https://suspilne.media/617383-pidozra-pro-derzzradu-dubinskogo-comu-ii-visunuli-ta-so-vidomo-pro-nardepa/) in treason (media/political influence), according to the investigation - activities in favor of the Russian Federation; [cases against V. Medvedchu](https://suspilne.media/1090542-medvedcuku-ta-se-12-ludam-zaocno-povidomleno-pro-pidozri-za-vipravdanna-zbrojnoi-agresii-rf-proti-ukraini/) (justification of Russian aggression, etc.). 

- Money/benefit (MICE: Money; RASCLS: Reciprocation/Scarcity).
  - Hypothesis: Economic incentives (reward, resources) increase vulnerability, especially under conditions of stress/scarcity (inflation, lack of income), but are not a sufficient cause in themselves - an opportunity and a recruitment channel are needed.

- Coercion/Compromise (MICE: Coercion/Compromise).
  - Hypothesis: Compromise or pressure induces information/facilitation; combined with access creates a risk of treason. (Analytics in intelligence approaches shows that coercion is a less stable, but real mechanism).

- Placement/access (RASCLS: Commitment/Consistency).
  - Hypothesis: high-ranking officials/officials with access to decisions or procedures can cause consequences of a state scale
  **Example:** [suspected of M. Azarov in treason for participation in the "Kharkiv agreements"](https://umoloda.kyiv.ua/number/0/180/155630) (investigation position — promoting the interests of the Russian Federation with consequences for the security of Ukraine).

# Conclusion

This project aims to analyze and identify the key factors and mechanisms contributing to particular crimes within the context of Ukraine from 2014 to 2024. The research highlights that such actions are often driven by a combination of motivational factors and tools of influence. Economic pressures and social conditions serve as contributing elements that increase vulnerability to such actions.

The project further explores theories related to political loyalty, financial incentives, and coercion as underlying factors leading to these activities. Through this analysis, we are able to build comprehensive graphs and visualizations that represent trends over time, illustrating the relationship between different influencing factors and crimes.

This project has laid the groundwork for ongoing data-driven analysis on how external and internal pressures interact with personal motivations, providing insights into potential interventions and preventive measures.
