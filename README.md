# Project Overview

The objective of this project is to gather, analyze, and visualize data related to crimes over the period from 2014 to 2024. We will examine the factors influencing the commission of particular crimes, analyze real-life cases, and present hypotheses on the primary mechanisms driving individuals to commit violations. The project will include visualizations (charts and graphs) representing data such as the number of cases over the years and months, suspicion reported, sent to court, proceedings closed,proceedings suspended, no decisions have been made.

The analysis is based on various articles and case studies, which will be examined in detail throughout the project. These articles explore the legal framework, contributing factors, and real-life examples.


## High treason (Article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine) and joint activities

- High treason - intentional actions of a citizen of Ukraine to the detriment of sovereignty, territorial integrity, defense capability, state security, etc.; during war, the application is strengthened by changes to the Criminal Code and the practice of distancing oneself from collaborationism `(Article 111-1)`.

  Qualification approaches and case law are discussed in detail in the article [Атонюк Н., 2022](https://www.academia.edu/download/88623963/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%96%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%B4%D1%96%D1%8F%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%96%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C.pdf). 

- Collaborative activities `(Art. 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine)` - a wider range of actions in favor of the aggressor state (information support, administration on TOT, etc.); it is important to correctly distinguish from Art. 111 when qualifying.

### Factors (mechanisms) influencing the commission of treason

A practical intelligence framework [MICE](https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/9ccc45dc156271d11769e5205ec49c29/Alt-Framework-Agent-Recruitment-1.pdf) explains the motivations for collaborating with the enemy
- Money, 
- Ideology, 
- Coercion/Compromise, 
- Ego 

The modern approach complements it with the model [RASCLS](https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/9ccc45dc156271d11769e5205ec49c29/Alt-Framework-Agent-Recruitment-1.pdf) as influence/recruitment tools.
- Reciprocation, 
- Authority, 
- Scarcity, 
- Commitment/Consistency, 
- Liking, 
- Social proof

### Hypotheses (factor → mechanism → example)

- Ideology/political loyalty (MICE: Money/Ideology/Ego ; RASCLS: Authority/Liking/Social proof).
  - Hypothesis: public figures with media influence/political connections can become leaders of the interests of the Russian Federation (info-operations, legitimization of decisions), which leads to treason.

    **Examples:** [suspicion of People's Deputy O. Dubinsky](https://suspilne.media/617383-pidozra-pro-derzzradu-dubinskogo-comu-ii-visunuli-ta-so-vidomo-pro-nardepa/) in treason (media/political influence), according to the investigation - activities in favor of the Russian Federation; [cases against V. Medvedchu](https://suspilne.media/1090542-medvedcuku-ta-se-12-ludam-zaocno-povidomleno-pro-pidozri-za-vipravdanna-zbrojnoi-agresii-rf-proti-ukraini/) (justification of Russian aggression, etc.). 

- Money/benefit (MICE: Money; RASCLS: Reciprocation/Scarcity).
  - Hypothesis: Economic incentives (reward, resources) increase vulnerability, especially under conditions of stress/scarcity (inflation, lack of income), but are not a sufficient cause in themselves - an opportunity and a recruitment channel are needed.

- Coercion/Compromise (MICE: Coercion/Compromise).
  - Hypothesis: Compromise or pressure induces information/facilitation; combined with access creates a risk of treason. (Analytics in intelligence approaches shows that coercion is a less stable, but real mechanism).

- Placement/access (RASCLS: Commitment/Consistency).
  - Hypothesis: high-ranking officials/officials with access to decisions or procedures can cause consequences of a state scale
  **Example:** [suspected of M. Azarov in treason for participation in the "Kharkiv agreements"](https://umoloda.kyiv.ua/number/0/180/155630) (investigation position — promoting the interests of the Russian Federation with consequences for the security of Ukraine).

## Intentional grievous bodily harm (Article 121 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). 

### Factors (mechanisms) influencing the commission of treason

### Hypotheses (factor → mechanism → example)
-----------

## Theft (Article 185 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine)
- Part 1 of Article 185 defines theft as the secret theft of another's property. The objective side of theft is expressed in the action - the secret, illegal, gratuitous, and against the will of the owner's property.

### Factors (mechanisms) influencing the commission of Theft

#### **Gary Becker’s Economic Theory of Crime (1968)**
[Article](https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/0973/BeckerCrimeand%2520P.PDF)

Explains crime as a rational decision based on weighing the expected benefits against the expected costs (probability of punishment × severity of punishment):

* motivation: material gain;
* factors: unemployment, income loss, financial pressure;
* mechanism: lower “opportunity cost” of legal work → higher attractiveness of illegal income.

#### **Empirical economic model of theft (Dündar)**
[Article](https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/intraders/article/1142732)

Finds strong statistical relationships between theft rates and:

* unemployment levels;
* inflation and price growth;
* income inequality;
* declining real wages;
* overall macroeconomic instability.


### Hypotheses (factor → mechanism → example)
#### 1. Unemployment → lower opportunity cost of legal alternatives → increased theft

**Hypothesis:** Unemployment reduce the relative value of legal work, increasing the likelihood of using theft as an alternative way to obtain resources.

#### **2. Inflation / rising prices → perception of scarcity → increase in petty theft**

**Hypothesis:** Rising food and essential goods prices create a sense of shortage, contributing to shoplifting and small-value thefts.

#### **3. Income inequality → perceived injustice / compensatory behaviour → higher theft rate**

**Hypothesis:** Income inequality increases subjective justification for theft as a way to “restore fairness” or compensate for disparities in access to goods.

## Brigandage (Article 187 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine)
Under Article 187 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, brigandage is defined as an attack with the aim of seizing someone else’s property combined with violence dangerous to life or health of the victim, or with the threat of such violence.

### Factors (mechanisms) influencing the commission of treason

* economic instability and unemployment [article](http://www.irbis-nbuv.gov.ua/cgi-bin/irbis_nbuv/cgiirbis_64.exe?I21DBN=LINK&P21DBN=UJRN&Z21ID=&S21REF=10&S21CNR=20&S21STN=1&S21FMT=ASP_meta&C21COM=S&2_S21P03=FILA=&2_S21STR=Unzap_2020_1_18)
* environmental and situational conditions [article](https://share.google/JqHxZKbeqkhSyA5KX)
* weak law enforcement presence and low deterrence[article](https://prikhodko.com.ua/my-i-zmi/my-i-zmi/stattya/rozbij-stattya-187-kk-ukrayiny-kvalifikacziya-rozboyu-sklad-i-oznaky-zlochynu/)

### Hypotheses (factor → mechanism → example)

Economic instability and unemployment → weakened legal alternatives → growth of violent property crimes

  Periods of economic recession, unemployment, and rising inflation lower the “opportunity cost” of legal work and create social tension. Individuals under financial stress may perceive violent theft as a faster or even necessary way to obtain resources.

Environmental and situational conditions → increased opportunity → concentration of robberies in vulnerable zones

  Poor lighting, lack of video surveillance, unguarded streets, or isolated dwellings reduce the perceived risk of being caught. These “opportunity structures” make robbery more feasible.

Weak law enforcement presence and low deterrence → reduced risk perception → cyclical growth of robbery rates

  When the perceived risk of arrest or conviction is low, potential offenders believe that violent property crimes are “worth the risk.”


## Froad (Article 190 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine)
According to Article 190 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, fraud is the taking of another's property or the acquisition of the right to property by deception or breach of trust. This crime is characterized by the intentional misleading of a victim so that they voluntarily transfer their property, the right to it, or provide financial funds.

### Factors (mechanisms) influencing the commission of Froad
 - development of digital financial technologies and growth of cashless payments [Article](https://share.google/WpUI7MT31oer6ORKl)
 - digitalization of society and low cyber literacy [Article](https://bastion.tv/diya-yak-zagroza-bezpeci-yak-derzhavna-cifrovizaciya-dopomagaye-shahrayam_n75196)
 - digitalization of government services [Article](https://elar.navs.edu.ua/items/7500134e-a424-4c2e-af2e-0d0c4bfa85ec)
### Hypotheses (factor → mechanism → example)
#### **1. Development of fintech technologies → creation of new remote deception tools → increase in phishing and fake online stores**

**Hypothesis:** The growing popularity of online shopping and cashless transfers increases the "attack surface" for fraudsters, who create phishing sites (copies of banks, postal services) to steal payment data.

#### **2. Digitalization + Low cyber literacy → high effectiveness of social engineering → increase in vishing (phone-based fraud)**

**Hypothesis:** Low public awareness allows fraudsters, posing by phone as "bank security" or "police," to persuade victims to voluntarily disclose confidential data (PIN, CVV, passwords) under the guise of "protecting" their funds.

#### **3. Digitalization of government services ("Diia") → exploitation of identification vulnerabilities → fraudulent microloan applications**

**Hypothesis:** Vulnerabilities in access recovery procedures allow fraudsters (by gaining control of a victim's phone number) to seize their BankID, access digital documents in "Diia," and use this data to apply for online loans in the victim's name.


# Conclusion

This project aims to analyze and identify the key factors and mechanisms contributing to particular crimes within the context of Ukraine from 2014 to 2024. The research highlights that such actions are often driven by a combination of motivational factors and tools of influence. Economic pressures and social conditions serve as contributing elements that increase vulnerability to such actions.

The project further explores theories related to political loyalty, financial incentives, and coercion as underlying factors leading to these activities. Through this analysis, we are able to build comprehensive graphs and visualizations that represent trends over time, illustrating the relationship between different influencing factors and crimes.

This project has laid the groundwork for ongoing data-driven analysis on how external and internal pressures interact with personal motivations, providing insights into potential interventions and preventive measures.
